# credit_default_notebook

This notebook is based on the data set used in the academic paper:
"The comparisons of data mining techniques for the predictive accuracy of probability of default of credit card clients. (Yeh I. C. & Lien C. H.,2009)"

By developing additional data set features and utilizing both logistic regression and a stochastic gradient descent neural model, 
we attempt to predict the likelihood a given credit card client will default on their credit payment in the coming month.
